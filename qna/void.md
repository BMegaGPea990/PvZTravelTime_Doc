# QnA about Void builds
Well this will be changed at anytime!

## Some QnA about Void-based versions:

> Q: Does this mod will come as native version for Windows?
>> A: Yes, we'll using the reworked PvZ Void as our mod base for Windows PCs.

> Q: Does Void version will replacing the original PvZ2 for base of this mod?
>> A: Maybe, I still need more time to code some stuffs to make it works exactly as the original PvZ 2 versions.

> Q: Does the Void version will be out on Android, iOS, Linux, & Mac?
>> A: For Android, I'm not sure about that, it depends to Xuwu as PvZ Void developer. For iOS and Mac, it's impossible because their proprietary system and Xuwu didn't make PvZ Void builds for iOS and Mac a.k.a Apple devices. For Linux, is having the same reason not to the proprietary system because it's build by community but Xuwu didn't make the Linux build too (Sorry, you need a Windows in a virtual machine.)

> Q: What is the system requirements to play this game?
>> A: [Read this](https://github.com/BMegaGPea990/PvZTravelTime_Doc)

> Q: Why the game is crashed when I launch it?
>> A: Try to update your operating system and drivers to the latest version, if it still not work try to reinstall DirectX. If it doens't work for you, you can pull issues (report issues) for that.
